# Reference Implementation (Thicket)

This folder contains the original Thicket implementation as a **reference only**.

These files show a complete real-world example of how the gallery system was used in production, but they contain client-specific branding and components.

**Do not use these files directly** - they are kept for reference purposes only.

## What's Here

- `configs/` - Gallery configurations for various components
- `renderers/` - Custom component renderers
- `mocks/` - Mock data
- `registry/` - Component registry and metadata

## For Your Own Project

Use the clean demo in `/demo` folder instead, which shows generic examples without client-specific branding.
